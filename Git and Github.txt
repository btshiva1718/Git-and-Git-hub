          GIT AND GITHUB QUESTIONS

1>what is the git and github?
Ans->   GIT
      	-Git is an open-distributed version control system and a software tool.
	-Developer makes a change to a code file, they can commit that change to their.
	-Developers can then pull the changes down from the remote repository and incorporate them into their code.
	-Git favors both programmers and non-technical users by keeping track of their project files.

      GITHUB
	-GitHub is web based GUI and Server for git.
	-GitHub offers VCS and SCM whereas git offers only VCS.
	-GitHub is hosting service for git repository,so that we can showcase our work to public.
 
2> What are the advantages of using Git?
	-> We can keep the track of every file whichever we push into the git repository
	-> Easy team Collaboration
	-> It'll maintain various versions of the code or files.
	-> We can use git for any sort of projects
	-> Redundancy and replication of data and highly available.


4>Explain about git architecture?

	- Git is a three tree architecture
		- The working Directory
			-It contains changes that may not be tracked by Git

		- Staging Index
			-It contains changes that about to be committed into the repository

		- Local Directory
			-It is being tracked by Git

3>what do you understand by term version control system?
Ans->	VCS is kind of software which helps the developer team to communicate and keep track of all changes happening to the files or code. 
     	It helps us to recover the code if we lose the code whichever we stored in our memory.
	Version control provides access to the historical versions of a project. So, If any mistake is made, you can easily roll back to a previous version.
	    


4>What are the diff types of version control system?

	3-types
		Local Version Control Systems
			It'll have a database that stores all file changes under revision control on disc in a special format.

		Centralized Version Control Systems
			Centralized Version Control Systems have a single repository, from which each user receives their working copy.			

		Distributed Version Control Systems	
			Distributed Version Control Systems contain multiple repositories, and different users can access each one with their working copy.		
	

5>what is git repository?
	It's a storage unit of all the git files and we can access it from our local machine as well as cloud.
	It'll keep track of the commit's made of the code.
		

6>Which command is used to initalize a repository in git?
	git init command is used to initialize an empty repository in git.

7>what is cloning?
	Cloning is making a temporary copy of Data.
	So, we can make any changes to our Temporary data so that our original data will not be affected.

8>How to clone your code into git repository?
	command - git clone <url>
		  using the above command we can clone the data.

9>What is push command, how do we push code into  git repository?
	-> push command is used for Transferring the data from the local repository to the Remote repository.
	-> By using the command git push origin main/master, we can push the changes available in the local repository to remote repository.
	-> We should commit the data before pushing it into the git repository
	-> git push -u origin main/master command is used to push the files or code without missing any modifications.
	-> git push -f origin main/master, using this command we forcefully push our code into the git repository
	   so that It'll resolve the warnings or errors automatically and push our code to the repository.


13>How to commit your data to git repository?
	-> Transfering the data from staging area to the git repository we use commit.
	-> We can also mention whatever the changes/updates that we have done to the file or Code through commit
	-> git commit -m <"commit_message"> - using this command we can commit the data to the git repository.


14>what is staging area (or) indexing in git?
	-> Staging area is place where we Add our code before we commit it into our git repository.
	-> Using git add <file_name> command we can transfer our data to the staging area.
	-> Staging area is located in between the data source and data targets.
	

15>What is the process to revert a commit that has already been pushed and made public? 
	-> Revert Command happens after commiting the data to the local repository
	-> Revert command is used to undo the updates/changes whatever we have commited to the existing code.
	-> git revert <commit> 


16>What is the use of the git config command?
	-> Git config is used to setup the Admin accessing details
	-> Examples for using the command
		git config --global user.email <email>
		git config --global user.name <name>

17>what does the git status command do?
	-> It'll be used to display the status of working directory
	-> It will display the file which we need track or add the file to the staging area.

18>What is the branching in git? which command is used to create branch?
	-> git branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
	-> Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch. When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.
	-> It allows developers to work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase.

19>Tell me something about git stash?
	-> git stash store the changes whichever made recently on local workspace
	-> git stash - command is used to save the work
	-> git stash save "<Stashing Message>"  - command is used to save the work with a message.
	-> git stash list - command is used to check the store stashes
	-> git stash show - This command will show the file that is stashed or changes made on them.

20>Diff btw git fetch and git pull?
	-> git fetch tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing into local repository
	-> git push is used to trasfer the changes which were present in the local repository to remote repository.


21. git fetch+git merge+git pull
is like updating the l.r with new commits from the r.r
22.git clone?
for downloading the contents grom r.r.
23.git rebase?
integrating changes from one branch to another.


24.git architecture?
it uses three-tree architecture which has working directory ,staging area, and repository
it has working copy and repository but in between there is staging area
when we do our first  commit we can't perform commit first we used to add the files  .once added then only we can committed.
after adding files to staging area from there we committed to repo.

Git Commands:
git init: to initialize the empty git repo.
git status: to know the status
git add .: to add all file
git commit -m "my first commit" : to commit the chanes to staging area.
git status : it will show all tracked and untracked files.
git add remote origin <url> : to add connection between l.r and r.r
git push -u origin master : to chnages from l.r. to r.r
git log : it will show all commits we did 
git branch <branch name> : to create a branch
git checkout <branch name>: to chane from one to another branch
git branch -d <branch name> : to delete a particular branch

Git branching: What is the purpose of branching?
Branching is used in version control and software management to maintain stability while isolated changes are made to code.
